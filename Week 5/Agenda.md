# Week 5 - Arrays!

## Code Review - danish flag - Thomas and Ivan
---

`fun`

## lota stuff to doa
---

`insert comforting lies here`

There may look like a lot of activities this week, however, this week we are focussing on code reuse. You will find that many of the functions you write in earlier activities can be re-used to help solve later ones.

## ASCII?
---

#### Parrot

Write some code to repeat what you type in!

#### Angry Parrot / Disgruntled Bird

Make the code convert everything to uppercase!

## Arrays
---

#### Basic Code

`void setArrayValues(int length, int array[], int value);`

#### Tests + Breaking and Hacking

What happens when we lie about size?

## Strings
---

Create some strings?!

#### Why do we store strings with a 0 at the end?

`   char stringA[6] = {72, 101, 108, 108, 111, 0};`

#### Difference between [] and * 

`code time -> string.c`

## devowel
---

`void devowel(char *string);`

do this pls and thank

## Swap Functions and Pointers
---

#### What is a Pointer?
Lets us do cool things and edit memory in ways we couldn't before. 

#### Code

go to -> swapFunction.c

## Style
---

With ass-0 coming up please go over your style (even if you have already submitted) to make sure you are doing the less obvious stuff

Constants are Snake Case and Upper Case `TRUE` `MAGIC_NUMBER`
this is not a good constant `True` or `FAlSe` or `MAGICNUMBER`

Function and variable names are always Camel Case with a lowercase first letter `helloWorld()` `i` `index` `count` `numForInput`

`No line should be more than 72 characters wide.`

`use prototypes!`

`comments before every function outlining what they take in, what they do and what they return`

```c
/*
 * Pow takes in two integers b and p
 * and returns a integer equal to b^p
 */
int pow(int b, int p){
    // magic
}
```

`Commas in argument lists for functions should never have a space before them and must always have at least one space after them.`

`use void rather then just ()`

`short many functions rather then long few ones`

`single return statement`

`spaces between if ( { and also =`

`no magic numbers!! if you have a number in the code, use a constant!`


## Lab Partners
---

Talk to some new people cause we are switching groups today, pick anyone but your last partner, must be new!!

create a new group on webcms!
