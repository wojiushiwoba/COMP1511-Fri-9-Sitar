# Week 2 - Chill

don't panic

# Question

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main(int argc, char* argv[]){
    // What does 1 mean?
    int cats = 10;
    int crazy = 1;
    if(cats == 0){
        printf("I have no cats\n");
    }
    else if(cats < 5){
        printf("I have some cats\n");
    }
    else if(5 < cats < 10){
        printf("I have possibly too many cats\n");
    }
    else if(cats == 10 && crazy){
        printf("I am a crazy cat person\n");
    }
    else if(cats == 10){
        printf("I am a cat person\n");
    }
    else if(cats == -1 || 11){
        printf("?????\n");
    }
}
```

# Style

4 spaces now
name variables well

# New lab structure / marking

**In general**

- x amounts of warm ups to help you ease into the pair challanges. These can be done individually. if they look easy, feel free to skip them. 
- y amount of pair challanges. Must be done and shown to me
- z amount of challanges. optional but good to do if you have a good grasp on the content. Feel free to come back to this later in the semester for practice. 

**For this week**

- 3 warm up
- 3 pair
- 1 challange

**Marking**

- show me (or adam) last weeks code working so we can make sure you get what's happening and also that your style is good. 
- Check the tutorial resources page to see a table with if we have marked you off for a lab. 
    + Also let me know if you have a pair name to replace the default!
    + I used the roll names just to get this organised, today when i come around just let me know if you'd like to change the name that's up there. 
    + If there is a star next to your name, i don't have a group written down for you! just grab me when you have a chance. 
- autotests are worth some marks so try to get them working

# Weekdays

`coding time!`

# Leap Year (note to future zain: aim to start this at 9:25/9:30)

#### How does `%` work?

```c
10%5 = 0
10%6 = 4
10%7 = 3
10%8 = 2
10%9 = 1
10%10 = 0
```

#### Draw some code

- groups of 4 and 10 minutes to design a flow
- draw up your flow diagram
- are they good??
- test cases
- how many different correct approaches did we get?
- why arn't we just coding??

#### Write some code

`coding time`
