> One of the most important rules from the course style guide is that every function should have one specific purpose. You should be able to describe what a function does with one simple statement.

1. Discuss with your class some strategies you can use to keep your code from becoming complex

2. strategies for making sure that your code is easy to understand.

3. Discuss how you might be able to tell if your code is becoming too complex or hard to understand.
