Take server.c and modify it in a number of ways

A) have it return HTML instead of plain text
B) have it return a simple html message, such as a bolded "hello world"
C) read through and understand the server so you know how to understand the request
D) using the request return some html that shows in the center of the screen "hello <NAME>" where NAME is given in the url.

I.e localhost:1511/zain will load up a html page with Hello Zain in the middle of the page. (the exact look isn't as important as getting it to work)
Run the example executable to get a feel for what you are trying to do.
