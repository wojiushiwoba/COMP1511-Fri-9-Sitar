## BMP Images
---

BMP or BitMaP

The information about the image is called the metadata and contains information such as

- how wide the image is,
- how high the image is,
- how many pixels there are, and
- where in the file to find the pixels.

We represent pixels as RGB value etc.

refer to `pacman.c`
